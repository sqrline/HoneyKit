## ðŸ–¥ Contributing

* Make sure no similar extension already exist in HoneyKit.
* A pull request should only add one extension at a time.
* Do not use an existing extension inside another HoneyKit extension.
* Code should follow [Swift Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
* Always declare extensions as public.
* All extensions should be tested.
* The file name should be based on the type that extends + added functionality. (Example: UIViewController+ShowAlert.swift)
* All extensions should be well documented.
